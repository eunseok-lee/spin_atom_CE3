This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNMCV system.
This program construct an artificial neural network, comprised of one hidden layer and one output layer, to fit the correlation matrix to the formation energy. The backpropagation algorithm and the sigmoid activation function were employed. In general, activation functions are not used for regression, however, it was for this program considering the noise in data (unconverged DFT calculations).
To compile this program, type 'make' at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_link_to_ann. Note that at present this program will perform only serial job although it will be compiled using MPI. Hence, use sing cpu to run the executable.

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided.

1) datainput_filename: filename for datainput matrix
2) datainput_rowsize: the number of rows in datainput matrix
3) datainput_colsize: the number of columns in datainput matrix
4) targets_filename: filename for target matrix
5) targets_rowsize: the number of rows in target matrix
6) targets_colsize: the number of rows in target matrix (e.g. 1 if the target is the formation energy only, which is usual)
7) nfu: the number of formula units, in case the values of target is too big or too small, this factor can work as a scaler.
8) max_iter: the maximum limit of the iteration
9) num_hidden_neuron: the number of neurons in the hidden layer
10) disp_freq: the frequency of display

These parameters should be written in param.dat. Note that the number of neurons in the output layer is set to be equal to targets_colsize inside the program.

In addition to param.dat, the following files also should be provided.
1) datainput file (e.g. corr_mat_ugs.dat): data input matrix for ANN, which is corresponding to the correlation matrix here
2) target file (e.g. Ef.dat): target feature, which is corresponding to the formation energy here

The files 1)-2) can provided from the result of running data_to_corr_mat3 (another program of the package), or other external programs.

You can run the executable as follows.

>>./run_link_to_ann

The following result files will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running.

1) hidden_layer.dat: the element of hidden layer matrix. Each row corresponds to each neuron.
2) output_layer.dat: the element of output layer matrix. Each row corresponds to each neuron.

So far, the performance of backpropgation algorithm, implemented in this version (v1), was not superior to the one using simulated annealing based on the cross-validation-score. If the performance is improved later by enploying other ANN techniques, the optimized network will be use used to predict the low energy structures.
