This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNMCV system.
This program constructs the CE correlation matrix from the coupled configurations of atomic species and magnetic moment.
The compilation of this program requires the libraries from GSL and Qhull. To compile this program, 'make' at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_data_to_corr_mat3.

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided.

1) np: the number of cationic lattice sites (anion lattice sites are not considered for CE)
2) neighbor_num: the number of neighbors of each atom
3) ncluster1: the number of cluster 1 types
4) ncluster2: the number of cluster 2 types
5) ncluster3: the number of cluster 3 types
6) ndata: the number of data
7) Ndim: the number of independent axis
8) near_convh_cutoff: the critical energy to filter out the data with extremely high Ef
9) qhullflags: Qhull precision option. Q0 is recommended.
10) use_anomaly_detection: 0-not use (use convexh only), 1-use anomaly&&convexh, 2-use anomaly||convexh
11) anomaly_score_crit: critical value of anomaly score, to determine the defective data
12) knn: the knn-th nearest neighbor instances will be considered for anomaly score.

These parameters should be written in param.dat.

In addition to param.dat, the following files also should be provided.
1) data_orig.dat: atomic species at each lattice site - size of ndata x np 
2) magmom_orig.dat: spin species at each lattice site - size of ndata x np
3) E_orig.dat: the electronic energy of each data set - size of ndata
4) Ef_orig.dat: the formation energy of each data set - size of ndata
5) map_to_cluster1.dat: mapping info, from a lattice site to point cluster type
6) map_to_cluster2.dat: mapping info, from a pair of lattice sites to pair cluster type
7) map_to_cluster3.dat: mapping info, from a set of three lattice sites to three-body cluster type
8) nlist.dat: neighbor list

The files 1)-4) should be provided by analyzing the data sets in the training set, while the files 5)-8) are provided from the result of running clusterlist (another program of the package).

You can run the executable as follows.

>>./run_data_to_corr_mat3

The results will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running, as listed in the following list.

1) result_param.dat
	1a) n_corr_mat_ug_row: the number of data set after post processing
	1b) n_non_singular_col: the number of non-singular cluster functions 
2) corr_mat_ugs.dat: the correlation matrix after post processing
3) Ef_ug.dat: the formation energy after post processing
4) usefulcorr_col.dat: the list of non-singular cluster functions
5) ef_conv_hull.dat: the convex hull of the formation energy (w.r.t. Li2O2, Ni2O2, Mn2O2, Co2O2, Va2O2)
6) tmp_Ef_u.dat: an intermediate file produced during post processing
7) tmp_corr_mat.dat: an intermediate file produced during post processing
8) tmp_nC_u.dat: an intermediate file produced during post processing
9) tmp_near_convh.dat: an intermediate file produced during post processing
10) tmp_nondegenerate.dat: an intermediate file produced during post processing

The parameters in result_param.dat and files 2)-4) will be used for findcluster3 and predictstructure_ce3
