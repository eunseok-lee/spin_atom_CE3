This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNMCV system.
This program formulates the clusters based on given lattice information.
To compile this program, type as follows at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_clusterlist.

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided.

1) pa: the lattice vector a
2) pb: the lattice vector b
3) pc: the lattice vector a
4) nbasis: the number of basis
5) basisfilename: the name of file that contains the position of basis atoms - the positions are expressed as fractional coordinates.
6) n1: the periodicity along a
7) n2: the periodicity along b
8) n3: the periodicity along c
9) neighbor_dist_max: the maximally allowed neighbor distance of each atom - only the neighbor atoms within this distance will be considered.
10) neighbor_num_max: the maximum number of neighbors of each atom - it will automatically reduced to the one corresponding to neighbor_dist_max.

These parameters should be written in param.dat and the basis information would be written in a file, name by basisfilename.

Both param.dat and the basis file (named by basisfilename) should be placed in the same directory as the executable.

You can run the executable as follows

>>./run_clusterlist

The results will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running, as listed in the following list.

1) result_param.dat: the parameters that specify the formulated clusters are stored in this file. Some of these parameters will be used later for the other programs.
	1a) np: the number of cationic lattice sites (anion lattice sites are not considered for CE)
	1b) neighbor_num: the number of neighbors of each atom
	1c) ncluster1: the number of cluster 1 types
	1d) ncluster2: the number of cluster 2 types
	1e) ncluster3: the number of cluster 3 types

2) map_to_cluster1.dat: mapping info, from a lattice site to point cluster type
3) map_to_cluster2.dat: mapping info, from a pair of lattice sites to pair cluster type
4) map_to_cluster3.dat: mapping info, from a set of three lattice sites to three-body cluster type
5) nlist.dat: neighbor list
6) nlist_dist.dat: list of distance to neighbor
7) rp.dat: fractional coordinates of cationic lattice sites
8) rpO.dat: fractional coordinates of anionic lattice sites
9) cluster2list.dat: the configuration of each pair cluster type
10) cluster3list.dat: the configuration of each three-body cluster type
11) store_pos2.dat: the example pair cluster
12) store_pos3.dat: the example three-body cluster
