This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNMCV system.
This program selects a set of cluster functions to produce the lowest cross validation score for given correlation matrix, using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to scan the configurational space.
The corresponding effective cluster interactions are also obtained.
To compile this program, GNU Scientific Library (GSL) should be pre-installed. Then, type 'make' at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_findcluster3.

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided.

1) corr_mat_ugas_filename: the filename of the correlation matrix after post processing in data_to_corr_mat3.
2) n_corr_mat_uga_row: the number of data set after post processing
3) n_non_singular_col: the number of non-singular cluster functions 
4) howmanycluster: the number of cluster functions to be selected
5) max_iter: maximum number of iteration
6) kT_ini: the thermal energy parameter in Boltzmann factor, in eV, at the initial step
7) kT_end: the thermal energy parameter in Boltzmann factor, in eV, at the end step 
8) cvs_tol: the critical value of cross-validation-score to finish the iteration
9) dispfreq: frequency of displaying & storing 
10) nfu: the number of formula unit
11) newstart: new start (1) or continuous run (0) of finding cluster. Default value is 1.

These parameters should be written in param.dat.

In addition to param.dat, the following files also should be provided.
1) corr_mat_ugas_filename (e.g. corr_mat_ugas.dat): the correlation matrix after post processing
2) Ef_uga.dat: the formation energy after post processing
3) usefulcorr_col.dat: the list of non-singular cluster functions
4) (optional) cluster_set1_cont.dat: cluster_set1 from the previous run, if newstart (in param.dat) is set to 0

The files 1)-4) can provided from the result of running data_to_corr_mat3 (another program of the package), or other external programs.

You can run the executable as follows.

>>./run_findcluster3

The results will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running, as listed in the following list.

1) cluster_set_N%d.dat: the selected cluster functions
2) x.dat: the effective cluster interactions

These results can be used for predictstructure_ce3.
